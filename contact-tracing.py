#     Menu:
#          1 -> Add an item
#          2 -> Search
#          3 -> Exit (y/n)
# - Allow user to select item in the menu (check if valid)
# - Perform the selected option
#         - Option 1: Ask personal data for contact tracing (Listed are sample only, add more)
#                    Use dictionary to store the info
#                    Use the full name as key
#                    The value is another dictionary of personal information
#         - Option 2: Search, ask full name then display the record
#         - Option 3: Ask the user if want to exit or retry.

# Note: 
# - Your program should be uploaded to github before 4pm
# - Record a demo presenting your program
# - Send the demo or link of demo directly to my messenger
